## Artist Statement
For this absract self-portrait, I was heavily influenced by artworks that delivered a cohesive message with the least information possible. Styles like minimalism and gesture drawings were best. The images that came to mind first were artists that I follow on Instagram. Griz and Norm Lemay's gesture drawings and Loui Christophe's one line drawings. I was also inspired by musical artists that I listen or used to listen to. BTS has a number of album art that uses minimal lines with a muted color palette. Their *Her* album art, depicting a flower, is one example that I looked at. Another artist album that inspired me was Marcus Jamal Hopson aka 'Hopsin''s single *Picasso*, displaying a Picasso inspired portrait of Hopsin. And while this was not exactly minimal, the balance between abstraction and realism is something I really admired.

I wanted to keep my project fairly simple in terms of value, anatomy and color. The amount of balance between realism and abstraction was something I figured out ealry on. The use of curved lines and gestural drawings helped me achieve a minimalist look so I can focus more on shapes and the essence of my portrait. 

Self portraits are a common first project for many art classes. Eventually the self-portraits we create also becomes a story. Our collection of self-portraits documents how we as artists have grown and how we percieved ourselves over the years. We change so much over the span of our lifetime, that it is difficult to pinpoint what caused us to change and when, but having documenting these portraits, we are able to go back to a time where we were potentially an entirely different person. This compelled me to to think about all the change I have yet to make, and [where do we go from here?](https://jvu11.github.io/Vu_Jonathan_ART2210/Projects/Portrait/Portriat.html)

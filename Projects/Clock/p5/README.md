[Time to try to totally tell time with three ticking time tellers](https://jvu11.github.io/Vu_Jonathan_ART2210/Projects/Clock/p5/Clock.html)

My goal was to map flights around the US from major airports on a certain day. I wanted to include a time slider to show the time of flights and layaways as well. I would have created my own JSON to include time and destination.
However, it proved to be difficult to animate an object with a factor of time and location. What I actually ended up doing was plotting different airports on the map and animated a circle with just location and not time. 
The result was a map with different flights going from one destination. The animation would replay by itself so you can look at each flight individually.
